    <p>Pasadena High School did not have a glee club two years ago, a problem that a friend of mine sought to fix. I am a singer and didn't have the room in my schedule to join choir. I was selected as Vice President of this club. I enjoy this club because it is fun and serves the community. We don't compete, we preform for elderly homes and the public.</p>
