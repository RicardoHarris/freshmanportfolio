    <p>Welcome to Brazz is my collaborative p5.js game that was made earlier this year, 2018. In this project, you are responsible for dropping a ball and hitting a paddle moving across the screen. Hit said paddle to increase your score! Miss the paddle and lose one of your three lives. Controls include the arrow keys to move left and right and spacebar to release the ball. My partner and I decided on a jazz-based aesthetic for Brazz because the genre, like the game, is smooth yet engaging. We used p5.js to build this project. The artistic freedom and sheer understanding that I had when building this product is what lead me to select this project as my favorite work from over the years.</p>
