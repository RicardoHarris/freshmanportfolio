    <p>In my high school Junior year science class, my 2 of my good friends and I made a commercial advertising human relocation to Mars. We scripted, filmed, and edited the commercial in a satirical light as Mars would be a terrible place to live. It was probably the most fun I've ever had in making a project. We were given much freedom in what this project could be and how we could make it. We decided on a commercial because one of us could write, another had a camera, and another edited. At one point, we had accidentally deleted everything. Somehow we were able to recover the source files from within the camera. At our filming location, I happened to be mere feet from a rattlesnake, unknowingly. Overall, it was a productive and enjoyable experience.</p>
